By determining a correlation between these variables, we can better determine which countries are major contributors of greenhouse emissions. For example, if population and greenhouse emissions are strongly correlated together, then we can focus on countries with large populations, since those nations will have the greatest influence over the volume of emissions. Furthermore, we'll get a better sense geographically for which countries are major contributors of emissions. \n",

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above analysis, it appears that land area and population do have some relation to CO2 emissions. In both cases, there is a positive correlation with a small slope. As surface area increases by 1 km^2, the model predicts an increase of 4.33*10^-3 millions of tons of CO2 / tons per capita. Similarly, as population increases by a thousand people, the model indicates that there should be about an increase of 0.052 millions of tons of CO2 / tons per capita. According to the linear regression model, countries which have a larger surface area on average produce more CO2 emissions. Likewise, countries which have a greater population on average produce more CO2 than countries with smaller populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the models above are only approximations and leave out important information. From the graph of Surface Area (km2) vs. CO2 emissions, we can see a few countries which emit a substantially larger volume of CO2 than other nations. These countries also lie above the regression line for both plots, which means they emit more CO2 than the models predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "One additional question that can be explored is whether population density is a better predictor of CO2 emissions than total population. A large population density value could be associated with urban areas and cities, and may therefore have a strong correlation with CO2 emissions. Another potential question to consider is whether CO2 emissions can be better predicted using both surface area and population as independent variables. This would require a multiple linear regression analysis. Finally, while the CO2 emissions from this dataset are normalized by population (e.g. divided by tons per capita), it may be worth considering what effect population and surface area have on raw CO2 emissions, for example in units of cubic meters.

    "Of the five types of governmental systems in the Stanford dataset, it appears that democracies, single party states, and monarchies emit more CO2 into the atmosphere than military states and multi-party systems. However, as seen from the bar graph, a few countries emit substantially more CO2 than the vast majority of other nations. These include China, The United States, and India. In fact, China emits about 2x as much CO2 as the US, which in turn emits more than 2x as much CO2 as India. Countries like China and the United States are responsible for drastically increasing the mean number of emissions of their respective government type. \n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of this analysis is that a specific government type may be significantly impacted by one or two countries. For example, if China was removed from this analysis, then the emissions of Single Party states would be substantially lower. Therefore, the aggregation step is outlier-prone, especially when aggregating by mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "A logical next step from this analysis would be to analyze which of the nations that are major emitters of CO2 are world powers. Moreover, it may be more valuable to group countries by other criteria, like whether a given nation is developed, developing, or underdeveloped. Another approach, for which we have already conducted some analysis, would be to classify countries by their economic status."
