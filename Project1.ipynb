    "**Initial Description:** We plan to analyze climate data based on country to understand which countries are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, what the characteristics of those countries are, and what negative effects greenhouse emissions have on people and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential research questions:**  \n",
    "    1. Which countries produce the most greenhouse gases? Which countries produce the least?  \n",
    "    2. Is there a correlation between GDP and greenhouse gas emissions?  \n",
    "    3. Does a country's use of renewable energy decrease their emissions?  \n",
    "    4. Does a country's population or land area have anything to do with greenhouse emissions?  \n",
    "    5. What forms of government do the countries that produce the most greenhouse gases have?  \n",
    "    6. Do greenhouse emissions come primarily from urban or rural settings?  \n",
    "    7. Which countries are affected most by greenhouse emissions?  \n",
    "    8. Do emissions impact human life expectancy?  \n",

    "**Question: Does a Country's Population or Land Area have anything to do with greenhouse emissions? (Atharva)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Does population or land area affect the volume of greenhouse emissions? By determining a correlation between these variables, we can better determine which countries are major contributors of greenhouse emissions. For example, if population and greenhouse emissions are strongly correlated together, then we can focus on countries with large populations, since those nations will have the greatest influence over the volume of emissions. Furthermore, we'll get a better sense geographically for which countries are major contributors of emissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question, data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/undata-country-profiles will be utilized. This data contains general information about each of the countries as well as social, economic, and environmental indicators. The dataset was extracted from information published by the United Nations, so it is a good authoritative source. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before analyzing the data, it will be helpful to define what units population, land area, and greenhouse emissions are measured in. Population will be measured in thousands of people, land area will be measured in square kilometers, and greenhouse emissions will be quantified in million tons / tons per capita. \n",
